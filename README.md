VSCode fork to make me a billionaire. 

# Jeditr
A lightweight editor built with Tauri, React, Monaco editor (used in VSCode), & xterm.js. 
The goal of Jeditr is to promote user learning by providing a peer-programming experience not offered by current AI driven editors.

A feedback loop is important to learn. Instead of waiting for a code review, Jeditr uses AI suggestions for code architecture and security while your editing.
